# ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è AirFly Project ‚Äì Milestone 1 ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è 

## Overview
This milestone focuses on the initial phase of the AirFly project ‚Äî selecting the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, preprocessing, and preparing it for dashboard visualization in Power BI.

---

## Main Tasks
1. **Select Dataset**  
2. **Perform EDA, Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Visualization**  
3. **Prepare Cleaned Data for Power BI Dashboard**

##  Tasks Accomplished

### 1 Dataset Selection
- **Chosen Dataset:** [Delayed Flights Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdurrehmankhalid/delayedflights)  
- **About:**  
  This dataset contains detailed records of delayed flights and is ideal for analyzing delay patterns, preprocessing techniques, and visualization tasks.  
  *(Used to practice real-world data science workflows ‚Äî from raw data to insights.)*

### 2 EDA, Data Cleaning & Visualization
**Key Insights from EDA:**
-  **Data Shape:** 1,936,758 rows √ó 30 columns  
-  **Missing Data:**  
  - Delay-related columns ‚Üí **35.59%**  
  - Time-related columns ‚Üí **0.43%**  
-  **Duplicates:** 0  

**Detailed analysis, visualizations, and feature engineering work** can be found in:

### 3Ô∏è Power BI Preparation
- Using the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for **dashboard development**.  
- **Dashboard creation** is currently **ongoing**.  
- Focus areas:
  - Delay distribution by airline and airport  
  - Flight time trends  
  - Predictive insights on delay causes  

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize Power BI dashboard layout  
- Add interactive visuals for better storytelling  
- Export cleaned data for model experimentation (optional extension)
